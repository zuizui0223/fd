# fd — literature and novelty positioning (2026-11-08)

**Working question:** Does the geological history of an island explain whether recorded floral phenotype space is locally restricted while geographically differentiated from other islands?

## Closest established research (the paper must NOT claim these as new)

|---|---|---|
| Global angiosperm trait biogeography (2026), *Nature Plants*, doi:10.1038/s41477-026-02358-w | Co-variation of 15 categorical taxonomic traits across >320,000 angiosperm species; geography and phylogenetic source structure strongly shape trait composition. | fd is **not** first global multivariate angiosperm trait mapping; proposed novelty instead lies in **geological-origin-specific local-vs-between island floral distances with conditional nulls**. |

## What would actually be new (conditionally; do not use 'first' yet)

The **joint** test of (a) local floral-functional dispersion `Q_i`, (b) between-island nearest-profile dissimilarity `NN_{ij}`, (c) island geological history, while (d) comparing to fixed-profile-margin, source/lineage, and data-coverage references on the **same eligible cohorts**. A genuine contribution must show the differences are not artefacts of trait imputation, source-availability, coarse floral categories, genus composition, island size/area or repeated pair dependence. This is a prospective new test, not an already established 'novel discovery'.

Do not substitute an arbitrary `distance_to_continent_km` cut-off for geological origin. The USGS Global Islands size classes ('Continental Mainlands / Big / Small / Very Small') **do not** classify islands as continental shelf versus oceanic geological origin. Geographic source type and geologic origin need independent provenance. A PCoA-2D 90% KDE area is a descriptive **projected** area retaining only 15.35% of common positive inertia; full floral hypervolume is not estimated.

## Competing hypotheses and required contrasts

- **Hgeo0 — shared island-assembly signature**: after matching richness, source/regime, area, distance and coverage, the residual within/between profile-space responses do **not** differ between oceanic and continental islands. Distinguish absence of evidence from equivalence.
- **Hgeo1 — origin-modified local restriction**: the distribution of `(Q_obs-Q_null)` or predeclared standardized effect differs across origins. It may have either direction; do not pick one after examining results.
- **Hgeo2 — origin-modified differentiation**: the observed-minus-null median nearest-profile distance between **within-origin** island pairs differs across origins. Equal numbers of physical islands and comparable partner degrees should be checked.
- **Hgeo3 — source/lineage explanation**: differences disappear when source membership, genus composition, floristic origin, and observation process are held fixed; this supports assemblage/history confounding rather than independent functional selection.
- **Hgeo4 — mechanistic interpretation**: only if independent pollinator performance/reproductive evidence identifies an association may the study claim functional pollination mechanism.

**Origin ontology (in priority order):** `oceanic` (volcanic, atoll, raised ocean-floor); `continental_shelf`; `continental_fragment`; `mixed`; `unresolved`. Main table may collapse shelf+fragment to `continental` with a predeclared heterogeneity sensitivity; keep mixed/unknown outside the binary contrast.

**Classification requirements:** carry original dataset/paper, source record ID, matched original island identifier, spatial correspondence diagnostics, conflict status and an audit class. Never assign an origin solely from nearest-continent distance, latitude or within a broad bounding box. If only a small high-confidence subset matches, report its narrow inference population, and keep the remaining global islands unclassified rather than forcing a global 'origin result'.

**Inference contract:** direct origin-by-endpoint interaction with uncertainty, not comparing two within-stratum p-values. Original G1 BH 13/32 vs BY 0/32 remains exploratory; rerun the null within comparable strata rather than simply subdividing its null distributions. No new origin-related positive result is currently supported without provenance-validated matched island labels.
