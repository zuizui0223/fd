# Same-species pollinator-shift feasibility: original GloBI v0.9 visitor evidence

**12 November 2026 · fd PR #14 · original-source, evidence-gated extension; ecological guild switching NOT established.**

## Why this is stricter than the original 928-island comparison

A geographical overlap between island plant species and a candidate GIFT native mainland list establishes a *source-opportunity NAME MATCH*, not that a documented island plant was visited by an independently identified pollinator or that a mainland population was ancestral. Similarly, a globally documented GloBI visitor guild associated with the **plant GENUS** is not direct evidence that an identified plant species or island population received pollen from that visitor.

We therefore rebuilt the **exact source-matched species** candidate set using ONLY:
- original Direct high/medium evidence with complete colour, form and symmetry;
- original source-verified native island flora, retaining only species present in one of the five geographically closest candidate GIFT native mainland source checklists;
- island record cohort with ≥30 directly trait-complete species;
- **qualified GBIF Bombus nondetection** and independent recorded flower-visiting bird animal occurrence.

This deterministic original frozen source selection reproduces **928 original eligible islands**, **21** Bombus-adequately-nondetected/bird-occurred islands, **197** native source-matched island×species rows, **54 accepted species / 49 genera**, on **13 focal islands**. Individual species, original island/source IDs and original GIFT checklist identities remain in the protected study workspace.

## Baseline direct floral / reproductive evidence among all 54 candidates

| Trait | Original high/medium Direct known species | Missing | Comment |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Flower colour | **54** | 0 | Species-wide categorical record only, not island population photo phenotype |
| Floral form | **54** | 0 | Open radial in 9/54, not universal across candidate pool |
| Floral symmetry | **54** | 0 | Actinomorphic in 38/54 |
| Flower size class | 30 | 24 | Direct categorical size, not flower-specific tube/fit measure |
| Tube depth class | 22 | 32 | Not all source-island pairs can compare potential access morphology |
| Self-compatibility / incompatibility | **17** | 37 | Only 17/54 direct SC/SI records; **not selfing rate or reproductive assurance** |
| Autonomous selfing capacity | 12 | 42 | One original state is mixed/variable, thus 11 unambiguous single categories |
| Mating system | **8** | 46 | Too sparse to estimate macro-scale selfing-shift coevolution |
| Inflorescence display | 42 | 12 | One direct state is mixed, not force-coded |
| Cleistogamy | 7 | 47 | Incomplete |

Using the previously frozen **GloBI global plant-genus** reference breadth data only, 33/54 candidates have a genus with ≥3 independent documented visitor-interaction references, and 15/54 have a genus with some bird documentary records. **Only 3 of those 15** have original open-radial floral form. These are taxonomic/documentation overlaps, not observed visitors of the 54 individual plant species.

### Cross-evidence attrition inside the native 54-species cohort

The old *globally documented GENUS-level* GloBI visit/breadth ledger yields ≥3 reference support for **33/54** species' genera and any global bird-channel reference for **15/54** species' genera. Among those **15** genus-bird-documentation candidates, only **6** have Direct species-level SC/SI evidence and **5** have Direct floral tube-depth evidence. Of the full 54, **9** have original Direct open-radial form (just **3** of the 15 genus-bird documentation candidates). Strict Direct high/medium reproductive record coverage is therefore inadequate for a bird-versus-bee pollination-service or mating-system adaptation model. These statements do **not** indicate actual bird interactions with any of the 54 named species.

The three older morphology-template candidates are poorly discriminating in exactly this 54-species cohort: only **5** have ≥3 Direct informative traits for `bird_like` and **4** have `bird_like` concordance ≥0.75 on those ≥3 traits. Only **3** candidates have ≥3 Direct informative traits for EACH of bee-like, butterfly-like and bird-like, and all three have high score in **all three templates**. These are overlapping morphology templates, not verified guild membership. Anonymous cohort aggregate: [`native_54_morphology_template_ambiguity.csv`](native_54_morphology_template_ambiguity.csv) and [`native_54_species_direct_functional_trait_coverage.csv`](native_54_species_direct_functional_trait_coverage.csv).

## Exact plant species × visitor reference retrieval implemented

To avoid projecting genus labels onto species, we implemented original GloBI v0.9 source-stream parsing in [island Draft PR #323](https://github.com/zuizui0223/island/pull/323): `src/island_v2/fd_globi_species_shift_v09.py`, `tests/test_fd_globi_species_shift_v09.py`, and the existing v0.9 SHA-pinned workflow.

The scanner:
1. Independently reconstructs and freezes the **same 54 native source-matched accepted plant names** from the original progressive island source and archived GBIF observation-state files; fails closed on sample drift.
2. Reads the exact **GloBI 2026-06-04 v0.9 `interactions.tsv.gz`** (SHA256 `095e57398420d1e0746e61233c796beedcfb8e03bd0c6a732aa17ae62043bd17`) in the SAME source pass used by the established provider audit.
3. Matches the **full plant species name**, not merely genus, on the correctly oriented source or target side of each of the four frozen flower-visitation/pollination RO predicates. Rejects records lacking a real plant kingdom, an identified visitor species, or one of the five preselected visitor guilds (Bombus, other bees, undivided Lepidoptera, birds, Diptera).
4. Separately counts raw exact-species hits, available original **provider AND bibliographic reference** evidence, duplicate references shared across provider labels, distinct cited interactions by species and guild, records explicitly labeled `pollination` vs `flower_visit`, plus **availability of record coordinates/event times**. A coordinate is NOT treated as exact island polygon membership.
5. Returns ONLY anonymous counts: number of the 54 species with any source-cited interaction, ≥3 distinct cited references, ≥2 recorded guilds, ≥2 source-archive labels, any georeference/date, and each of five guilds' count. **Zero documented matching records means GloBI evidence absent, not true pollinator absence**.

Source/role/missing-documentation/reference reuse and candidate selection synthetic tests all passed locally; the GitHub workflow performs source-pinned original-data tests before publishing a restricted-ID-free receipt. At the time of this report, **the original v0.9 stream was still running; no empirical exact-species GloBI support count is claimed yet**. A positive global species-linked record, when found, is STILL NOT proof it belongs to the focal island or the candidate GIFT mainland source population.

## Biological question and decision conditions

The paper should treat three nonidentical hypotheses separately:
- **Flora sorting / source-pool filtering:** existing floral trait states and taxon frequencies differ between the island flora and geographically plausible mainland plant pools. Already observable, but no ecological mechanism established.
- **Real ecological pollinator switching:** the *same native plant species* or a supported island sister lineage has standardized and *location-specific* pollen-effective visits from different guilds in the source mainland and on the focal island.
- **Functional compensation / generalized visitation:** source pollinator reduction does not induce a one-for-one switch; multiple visitors could share pollination service on the island, possibly with no large change in floral structure.

The exact 54-species GloBI scan is **evidence feasibility**, not the endpoint: an independently verified island and mainland coordinate assignment or direct population interaction dataset is required to claim switching. Additional original flower phenotype **by population**, effective pollen deposition/fruit set or controlled pollen-limitation tests are required to make a claim about syndrome evolution or service compensation.

Only the first hypothesis currently has source-pinned descriptive results; the other two are not rejected, simply **unidentified in existing input schemas**. We keep fd PR #14 Draft and do not count globally genus-linked bird references as 15 actual bird-pollinated island species.

## Verified original-data result: 27 source-cited exact species

This gate **has now been passed at the GLOBAL species-name level**. Original source [island run #43144106425](https://github.com/zuizui0223/island/actions/runs/43144106425) **completed successfully**, with [anonymous artifact #13911307901](https://github.com/zuizui0223/island/actions/runs/43144106425/artifacts/13911307901) and SHA-verified exact GloBI June 4 2026 v0.9 `interactions.tsv.gz` (`095e57398420d1e0746e61233c796beedcfb8e03bd0c6a732aa17ae62043bd17`).

The frozen **54 native plant species whose accepted names match candidate mainland GIFT native source checklists**, from 13 of 21 candidate islands, had the following actual source-reconstructed evidence:

| Real source-v0.9 identity and provenance check | Observed value |
| --- | ---: |
| Original GloBI rows streamed | 24,577,183 |
| Flower-interaction predicate rows with exact plant-species match | **1,123** |
| Retained records among five chosen guilds, correct plant kingdom and named visitor species | **792** |
| Distinct exact plant species with ≥1 real bibliography-backed guild interaction | **27/54** |
| Plant species with ≥3 distinct bibliography keys | **12/54** |
| Plant species with two or more globally documented visitor guilds | **11/54** |
| Species with at least one explicitly classified `pollination` interaction | **7/54** |
| Species with explicitly classified `flower_visit` interaction | **25/54** |
| Species represented under ≥2 archive-first original provider labels | **5/54** |
| Species with any source coordinates | **27/54** |
| Source-eligible georeferenced interaction rows | **642/792** |
| Plant species with coordinates in at least two distinct rounded 0.1-degree grid cells | **13/54** |
| Distinct original species×guild×provider×bibliography×evidence-class units | **622** |
| Original v0.9 `eventDateUnixEpoch` available | **NO** (missing field, dating unassessable) |

**Exact species-based global documented visitor guild evidence** (guilds overlap, so counts cannot be added):

| Global documented channel | Species with ≥1 bibliography-backed record | Species with ≥3 bibliography keys |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Bombus | 4 | 3 |
| Other bees | 14 | 7 |
| Lepidoptera (moth and butterfly NOT separated) | 20 | 11 |
| **Flower-visiting birds** | **5** | **2** |
| Diptera | 5 | 1 |

The previously reported **15 bird-associated *genera*** among these 54 plant species were a different and weaker proxy; only **5 plants have independently retrievable exact plant-species–bird-channel GloBI records**, and 2 have ≥3 distinct bird bibliography keys. This is a major difference between genus-level extrapolation and actual plant identity. The **11 species with 2+ globally documented guilds** are candidates for **pollinator generalization/interaction rewiring**, but **not** evidence that distinct guilds visited the same location, that both effectively transferred pollen, or that a change occurred after island colonization.

Neither 622 source-documentation units nor 642 georeferenced relation rows establishes the number of independent field studies, and the earlier source v0.9 concentration audit found one archive-first provider label disproportionately dominates global reference units. Source crossprovider duplicates are excluded by the original audit; only **5/54 plant species have evidence associated with two or more provider labels**. Provenance unit definitions remain stricter than raw interaction row counts.

### True island-versus-mainland switch remains geographically unassessed

The **642** nonempty-coordinate records have NOT been spatially joined to the original frozen GSHHG island polygons and relevant candidate GIFT mainland regions; a globally georeferenced species record cannot be called an observation on any of the 13 focal islands by species name alone. The original frozen geometry artifact #8066083419 was checked and is **no longer accessible (expired 2026-10-01)**. Do **not** replace it with an unverified Natural Earth geometry, approximate island centroid radius or arbitrary map rectangle and label that a local visitor record.

If the original GSHHG 2.3.7 high-resolution polygon layer is reconstructed from its independently pinned archive SHA256 `8dbbe7e071e77e9e75f2d639239099ebca8d5c16d6a07df8169729d49f15cf41`, island polygon equality and exact-island plant species overlap must be revalidated BEFORE any genuinely local interaction evidence can be counted. Even then, the v0.9 original has no event-time field and the `pollination` label may reflect an observer interpretation, not pollen transfer/fruit set.

### Current scientific conclusion

- **Confirmed source-backed result:** 27 native island/GIFT-source candidate *plant species* have original GloBI five-guild *documented global* flower interaction evidence, 11 have multiple guilds documented, 7 have explicit pollination-labeled rows, and 5 have exact species-associated bird-channel references.
- **Not confirmed:** a single 13-island plant species with both independently sampled island and mainland flower visitation guild composition or effectiveness; a historical bird-for-bee, moth-for-bee or multiple-guild compensatory **pollinator shift**; island-local floral form evolution. Data absence is **not proof of no true shift**.
- **New study design implication:** test the original documented **5 bird species**, **11 multiguild species** and **12 bibliography-rich species** for actual spatially linked source/island visitor information; do not select them because of favorable sign in a guild model and do not turn genus template scores into known pollinator identities.

## Dominant GloBI archive omission: the exact species-level bird signal largely disappears

A SOURCE-v0.9 original [Actions #43160907960](https://github.com/zuizui0223/island/actions/runs/43160907960) **SUCCEEDED**, yielding anonymous [artifact #13917963603](https://github.com/zuizui0223/island/actions/runs/43160907960/artifacts/13917963603) with an exact-species (NOT genus) **original provider-label omission audit**. The **same 54 candidate plants** were retained as the candidate universe; no observation or flower form was used to choose a favorable source subset. The largest archive-FIRST label accounts for **95.016%** of the **622** exact species×visitor guild×provider×reference×evidence-class units. Only **8** original archive-first source labels were represented for these 54 species. Removing the dominant source label leaves:

| Named-plant GloBI original evidence | Before source-label deletion | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Species with one or more globally cited flower-interaction records | **27/54** | **7/54** |
| Species with 3 or more bibliography keys | 12/54 | **3/54** |
| Species documented globally with 2+ visitor guilds | 11/54 | **4/54** |
| Species with ≥1 explicitly `pollination`-classified record | **7/54** | **7/54** |
| Documented Bombus guild species | 4 | **0** |
| Documented other-bee guild species | 14 | **7** |
| Documented Lepidoptera guild species | 20 | **4** |
| Documented bird guild species | 5 | **1** |
| Documented Diptera guild species | 5 | **2** |
| Species with ≥3 bird-channel bibliography keys | 2 | **0** |

This is a decisive **data-source concentration / evidence-attrition finding**, not evidence that a biological pollinator guild was extirpated. The persistently documented seven species with explicitly labeled pollination claims are potentially useful follow-up cases but original `pollination` record types are not independently verified seed set, and one archive may group several contributing studies. The **genus-level** positive bird-reference prediction after dominant-source omission has a much weaker **exact species-level** supporting evidence base; these two distinct analyses should never be presented as equivalent.

*Research-safe conclusion:* The original data can identify some species with references to more than one visitor group, but **source-disjoint local visitor turnover is not measured**. The narrow observational claim `11 distinct plant species with ≥2 globally documented guilds` drops to `4` after removing a coarsely defined dominant archive-label group. It is more accurate to interpret this as **global documented multi-guild interaction opportunities** than an evolutionary pollinator shift or field-level functional compensation.

## Geographic audit blocker, with no false island-local positives

The original frozen exact-GSHHG 8265-island geometry artifact #8066083419 expired 1 October 2026. Source-run independently downloaded the official **exact original GSHHG 2.3.7 h archive** and verified its pinned original ZIP SHA256 `8dbbe7e071e77e9e75f2d639239099ebca8d5c16d6a07df8169729d49f15cf41`. **But** reconstructed current polygon processing from the same GSHHG source produced **8260 polygon IDs rather than historical 8265**: **9 original IDs missing**, **4 newly generated IDs not in the frozen source universe**. This genuine original-geography/version drift means that a globally georeferenced original GloBI relation must NOT be simply labeled as on one of the original study's focal islands based on a different map layer. The geometry workflow [#43162269986](https://github.com/zuizui0223/island/actions/runs/43162269986) **failed closed**, as required by the registered identity contract.

We have also implemented a stricter **focal-island-only** check that retrieves the original 928 Direct trait-complete floras and independently qualified island visitor states and tests whether **ALL 21 focal island WKB-derived original IDs** are preserved exactly, even when other historical islands' hashes drift. This can unlock **only those 21 original matching polygons**; it cannot be called a globally verified 8265-polygon rebuild, and it cannot establish any mainland source population or pollen delivery. The [corrected focal-geometry workflow](https://github.com/zuizui0223/island/actions/workflows/run-fd-globi-gshhg-geometry-preflight.yml) has been triggered, but focal identity completeness has NOT been verified at the time this report was appended. Original source geography+species-level matching must remain blocked if a single focal ID fails.

Conclusion for the paper: **keep direct morphology and flora-assembly results as the core; use species×guild citations and archive fragility as an evidence audit, never as verified same-species island pollinator replacement or bird syndrome evolution.**
