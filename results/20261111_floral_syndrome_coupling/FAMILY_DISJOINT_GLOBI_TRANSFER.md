# Plant-family-disjoint prediction of GloBI documented visitor-channel composition

**11 November 2026 | exploratory, source-pinned fd PR #14.** This is an original-data follow-up to `GLOBI_CHANNEL_COMPOSITION_TRANSFER.md`. The dependent variable is **the share of GloBI-DOCUMENTED flower-interaction reference-channel units**, not real island pollinator abundance, current island visitation, effective pollen transfer, pollen limitation or seed set.

## What is held out

The previous 486-**genus** fivefold prediction showed that three coarse morphology fractions (actinomorphy, open-radial flower form, green/brown inconspicuous colour) improved genus-heldout five-channel MSE relative to the frozen source-documentation-only baseline.

The new test holds out **EVERY genus belonging to the same botanical family** together. There are **486 matched genera**, originating from **1,597 Direct/high-or-medium, strictly single-state flower morphology species**, in **88 GBIF-backed candidate families**. Mapping uses the frozen publicly recorded `island` `data/v2/staging/gbif/collected/island_taxa.csv` on commit `3bfa818ffbc7a0dea4319933c4b0a0eb41cfabb5`, blob `5ae92313517118f0dbb29d8863aa2e379ce88747`. All 486 matched genera had a recorded family assignment, but **two genera have competing historical vs current family labels** (majority label selected only as an exploratory test, and a two-genus-exclusion sensitivity is required). This is *not* an independently curated species phylogeny or authoritative WCVP full-family crosswalk.

The source GloBI v2 archive is the exact earlier `island` artifact `10328696801` (run `34790842133`); the protected Direct trait source is the earlier SHA-verified artifact `10058653212`. None of these original identities or row-level source interactions is published here.

Identical evaluated genera, five-channel GloBI reference proportions and covariates are used by every model:
1. **Evidence only:** log GloBI independent reference count, logged represented source plant count and Direct flora measurement count per genus.
2. **Three morphological proportions:** evidence + actinomorphic, open-radial and inconspicuous flower proportions.
3. **All marginal trait proportions:** evidence + 22 single-trait colour/form/symmetry state frequencies.
4. **Detailed joint profiles:** marginals + floral colour×form×symmetry joint category frequency features, 115 features total.

Fivefold family-disjoint CV, with five outcome-blind family fold assignments and fixed ridge strengths 10 and 100. Fit standardization on training families only, then project predicted five-channel compositions onto the unit simplex. Reporting uses equal genus weight; report family-balanced and leave-largest-family sensitivities. No family or genus identity enters the predictive feature matrix or is exported in results.

## Measured heldout-family result

For the first family-disjoint seed, ridge 100, the pooled five-channel MSE is:

| Model | Previous entire-genus holdout MSE | New entire-family holdout MSE | Family-heldout improvement vs evidence only |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Evidence only | 0.041396 | **0.041970** | reference |
| + Three coarse morphological rates | 0.039785 | **0.040451** | **+0.001519 (3.62% lower)** |
| + All 22 individual category marginals | 0.038272 | 0.041065 | +0.000905 (fragile) |
| + 115-dimensional joint floral profiles | 0.043707 | **0.049705** | **−0.007735 (worse)** |

**Three-trait gain remains positive for all five family-fold assignments** and both ridge strengths. Ridge 100 gains **+0.001240–+0.001519**, ridge 10 gains **+0.001145–+0.001473**. Excluding both ambiguously assigned-family genera yields ridge-100 gains **+0.001207–+0.001422** across five assignments. The largest individual family contains 58/486 evaluated genera; dropping that family from scored genus rows retains gain **+0.001977** in the first main split. **Excluding the five largest families simultaneously**, leaving **312 genera**, retains positive gains in all five family-fold arrangements (ridge 100: **+0.001111–+0.001421**). This is a scored-test-unit deletion diagnostic; models were not re-trained after removing those families. Only **48/88** families show a positive family-specific mean gain for the first split, so the finding is heterogeneous.

A conditional **4,999 whole-family bootstrap** for the first genus-weighted gain gives **[+0.000403,+0.002716]** at the nominal 95% interval. This does not yield independent phylogenetic replicates: family histories and source publication biases may remain correlated.

**The detailed category-marginal model is not robust**: ridge-100 gain varies from **−0.005122 to +0.001658** over family-fold assignments, and its sign changes if two taxonomy-conflicted genera are excluded, partly because the balanced fold membership changes. All high-dimensional full-joint models are worse (ridge-100 gains −0.010519 to −0.005384). One cannot claim learned detailed or exclusive bee/moth/bird floral syndromes.

### Independent numerical cross-check

An independent implementation used scikit-learn's `GroupKFold(5)`, `StandardScaler`, `Ridge` (alpha100), and the same simplex projection, distinct from the custom outcome-blind family-balancing implementation. Its evidence-only MSE was **0.041835**, coarse 3-trait MSE **0.040630**, **gain +0.001205**. The joint 115-feature model worsened by **0.004984 MSE**. This confirms numerical direction across two different blocked-fold procedures, **not new independent botanical evidence**.

## Falsification by within-family floral-label reassignment

For the first family-heldout fivefold test (alpha100), shuffle the **WHOLE three-dimensional coarse morphology vector** among different genera *inside the same botanical family*, keeping each family-level floral distribution, all GloBI documentation evidence/counts and the source-channel outcome unchanged. Among 88 families, **51 have >=2 genera**, allowing **449/486** genus morphological vectors to be shuffled.

Over **999** within-family label shuffles:
- actual pooled gain **+0.001519**;
- posthoc shuffled median **+0.000650**;
- shuffled central 95% interval **[+0.000291,+0.001078]**;
- upper-tail fraction with +1 correction = **0.001**.

Thus the gain is not reproduced by genus-level morphology rearrangements that preserve each family's overall coarse morphology. This is a useful **family-conditioned predictive placebo**, but still not a fully conditioned phylogenetic/source-provider null, ecological selection test, or actual-island pollinator measurement. The 37 families with only one sampled genus necessarily cannot be shuffled.

## Robust scientific claim and limits

**Supported at predictive/evidence level:** directly recorded, coarse floral morphology carries a **small** amount of additional information about the relative global GloBI-DOCUMENTED five visitor-channel references, even when test genera come from entirely untrained botanical families and when shuffles preserve family-level morphology. The original genus-heldout finding is therefore **not solely a same-family sharing artifact**, and it is not trivially the broad literature-reference-count gradient.

**Not established:** a classification of actual bee, butterfly, moth, fly or bird pollination of a plant species or island; moth vs butterfly separation (GloBI channel is combined Lepidoptera); visitor abundances or effective pollen transfer; independent floral syndrome evolution; pollen limitation mediation; pollinator-driven adaptation. Unrecorded GloBI channel evidence is NOT biological absence. The 928-island GBIF channel evidence has only 33 strict mixed-status islands, and 0 of 20 region×guild contrast support cells pass the earlier ecological gate. Whole-family taxon mapping is from a candidate GBIF table, and the matched trait-observed genus subset is highly selected. Many genera can share evidence providers across family boundaries. Neither bootstrap nor 999 feature permutations creates new external biological observations.

**Next identification gate:** use independent real island visitor samples with explicit study effort, or a separate visit-effectiveness/pollen deposition database; before any causal claim audit WCVP/phylogenetic family labels and GloBI original publication-source overlap. The 486-genus GloBI predictive endpoint remains a documentation endpoint, not ecological service.

- Public, pure `src/fd/globi_family_holdout_cv.py`: unique-genus/family validations, five balanced whole-family test folds, leak-free ridge, simplex constraint, equal-family/cluster sensitivity and within-family three-trait label placebos.
- Synthetic regression tests in `tests/test_globi_family_holdout_cv.py`.
- Public nonidentifying aggregate tables: family-vs-genus heldout scores across five family-fold assignments, independent GroupKFold check, whole-family conditional intervals, per-channel output and within-family shuffles. The **genus-to-family mapping and original species, GloBI reference/interaction and island rows remain in a private local source-audited workspace**.
- Original GitHub Actions source artifact and blob identifiers allow auditing under the original data rights. Public GitHub CI checks synthetic algorithms and confidentiality only; it **does not independently rerun the source-restricted original-data calculations**.


## Trait ablation: floral access structure rather than simple colour drives the transfer

To prevent overinterpreting the island colour×architecture correlation as a working *multivariate pollination-syndrome classifier*, freeze the same **486 genera / 88 family** test frame, evidence-only source reference controls, same five family-disjoint fold assignments and ridge alpha100, then compare the three coarse floral features separately and in pairs.

| Added Direct morphology over source-effort baseline | Mean five-channel MSE reduction across 5 family fold seeds |
| --- | ---: |
| Inconspicuous (green/brown) colour fraction ONLY | **−0.000006** |
| Actinomorphic symmetry fraction ONLY | +0.000610 |
| Open-radial flower-form fraction ONLY | +0.001021 |
| Actinomorphy + open-radial form | **+0.001364** |
| All three including inconspicuous colour | **+0.001357** |

The *incremental* effect of adding this colour fraction after form+symmetry is **−0.000007 on average**, with fold-specific values −0.000039, +0.000026, −0.000008, +0.000017 and −0.000032. **Colour adds no robust out-of-family predictive skill in this coarse design.** In contrast, excluding either of the two floral structural axes weakens the prediction. Form and symmetry are partially ontologically overlapping, so their components do not constitute two independent ecological processes.

An additional 999-draw, intact **TWO-STRUCTURAL-TRAIT vector** permutation strictly within each GBIF-backed botanical family (fixed first family CV fold, alpha100) gives observed five-channel MSE reduction **+0.001558**, placebo median **+0.000729**, 95% reference interval **[+0.000397,+0.001068]**, exploratory upper-tail fraction **0.001**. This supports a within-family genus-level *recorded morphology–documentation* association for structural proxies, without establishing actual flower–visitor functional fit.

**Tighter conclusion:** the small generalizable signal is principally about the plant's **structural visitor-access architecture**, not the full colour×form×symmetry combination and not even the particular green/brown-versus-other colour contrast. The independent island flora result that colour/architecture combinations are nonrandom remains valid, but that co-association **has not been shown to improve out-of-family GloBI visitor-channel prediction**.

This finding does NOT mean other optical signals (UV patterns, spectral reflectance, nectar guides) are unimportant; those were not included in the present three coarse summary features. The source GloBI five-channel shares remain global documented references, not the pollinator community physically on each island.
